    "\n",
    "#### This activity should teach you:\n",
    "- What are control structures\n",
    "- How to use `if`/`elif`/`else` (decision) structures\n",
    "- What a loop is\n",
    "- What is the difference between `while` and `for` loops\n",

    "As you run a program, you may want to make decisions or repeat code. Control structures allow you to guide the progression through the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision structures are important for dealing with:\n",
    "- Situations with multiple inputs (data, function arguments)\n",
    "- Iterative processes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three keywords to know: `if`, `else`, and `elif`.\n",
    "\n",
    "All decision structures begin with an `if` header. The `if` keyword is followed by a boolean expression. _If the boolean is true_, the body is run."
