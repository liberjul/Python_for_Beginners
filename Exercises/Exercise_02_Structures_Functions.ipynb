    "Python for Beginners Exercise 2: Sructures and Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Made by: Julian Liber\n",

    "Date Created: 03/16/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hello Everyone!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This activity should teach you:\n",
    "- How to import packages/modules/libraries\n",
    "- What are structures such as strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries\n",
    "- Why might you use certain structures?\n",
    "- What is a function\n",
    "- How do you write a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as biology is often focused on the relation of structure and function, programming relies on both these critical parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also Python benefits from extensive outside resources, called packages, modules, or libraries. These can provide some impressive functionality, but probably won't make you fly.\n",

    "### Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Data structures are a way of organizing data and how to access it. I'll talk about these structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strings (we've already talked about these, but not as structures)\n",
    "- Lists\n",
    "- Dictionaries\n",
    "- Numpy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Each structure has _attributes_ and _methods_, which can be accessed by dot notation, or by functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes are something about a structure, while methods are something it can do. Methods have parentheses `()`, while attributes do not. If something doesn't work, try adding or removing parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some structures also have indexing using square brackets `[]`, which allows for accessing data by its position or keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A string of characters has a length, which can be determined using `len()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use methods such as `count()`, which shows how many times a shorter string occurs within the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "To index the string, a number corresponding the the position is used (starting at 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are _immutable_, in that string cannot be changed."
