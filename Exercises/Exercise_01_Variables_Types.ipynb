    "\n",
    "This is a Jupyter Notebook. It allows for running code easily in your browser. If it is run using Google Colab, you will not have to download anything to your computer, but it is good to know how to use your own device.\n",

    "Python is a coding language that is useful for a variety of tasks. I use it for reading and writing files, handling image data, and for machine learning tasks, but it is very helpful for all sorts of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any language, Python has specific syntax and rules for its use. Learning these will be the main task, while specifics are often looked up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, a _function_, such as `print()`, takes an input, and does something. These will be discussed more later. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A varible is identified by a _name_, which is associated with a _value_. The value is stored at an _address_, but we do not need to think about the address in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We _assign_ a variable using the equals sign (`=`). The equals sign here is an _operator_, or a symbol with a specific action.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any text after a `#` will be ignored. These are called _comments_.\n",
