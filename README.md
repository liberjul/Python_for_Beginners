# Python_for_Beginners

An introduction to Python for Bioinformatics

## Getting Started

To run python, we are going to use Jupyter Notebooks. The easiest way to get started using python is to install Anaconda, with Python 3.7.

- [Download Anaconda here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
- [How to install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

Choose the version which matches your operating system. **When asked if you want to add Anaconda to the path, choose yes**.

If you want to have access to the Anaconda distribution on the HPCC, follow the instructions on [this page](https://wiki.hpcc.msu.edu/display/ITH/Using+conda#Usingconda-InstallationofAnaconda).

### To access the content on this page

Open a terminal, either using the terminal app in MacOS or by searching "cmd" in the Windows search box.

Use the command `ls` to show the files and folders in the current directory, then use `cd <myfolder>` to navigate into your desired location (replacing `<myfolder>` with the folder name).

Run this command: `git clone https://github.com/liberjul/Python_for_Beginners` (type or copy+paste the command, press Enter)

If your computer did not recognize the command `git`, install git using this [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

As new material is uploaded, you will need to run through these commands:

```
git add <saved_file1> <saved_file2> ...
git commit -M "<my message>"
git pull

```

Now run this: `jupyter lab`

Now you can navigate to the Python_for_Beginners directory and run the notebooks in the Exercises directory.

### If you don't want to install anything (This is recommended only as a temporary measure).

Click on the notebook links to run them in Google Colab:
